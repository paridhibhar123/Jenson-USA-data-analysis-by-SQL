The Jenson USA Sales Analysis project leverages the BikeStores sample database to generate actionable business insights across sales, inventory, and customer behavior. Using SQL, multiple datasets—covering products, categories, brands, stores, staff, customers, orders, and stock—were joined and analyzed to answer key business questions.

The analysis identified the total products sold per store, cumulative product sales over time, highest-selling and highest-priced products per category, and top-performing stores. It also pinpointed high-value customers, unsold products, and top staff contributors, while highlighting purchasing patterns across different customer segments.

Advanced SQL techniques, including joins, aggregations, subqueries, and window functions, were used to uncover trends such as top 3 most-sold products, customers who purchased across all categories, and median pricing insights. Recommendations were made to boost sales of unsold products through targeted promotions, bundling, and better product presentation.

The insights from this project support data-driven decisions for sales growth, optimized inventory management, and enhanced customer satisfaction—demonstrating strong analytical, problem-solving, and database management skills.
